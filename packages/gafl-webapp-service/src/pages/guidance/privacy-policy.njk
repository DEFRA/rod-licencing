        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How we use personal data</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">We are the Environment Agency and the official authority for issuing fishing licences. We run the Get a fishing licence service and are the data controller for this service. A data controller determines how and why personal data (personal information) is processed.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">Our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/environment-agency/about/personal-information-charter">personal information charter</a> explains how we deal with personal data.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">The personal data we need</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">The personal data we collect about the angler includes:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>name and address</li>
            <li>date of birth</li>
            <li>contact details</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">Processing personal data is necessary for the Environment Agency to issue a licence to fish in England (except the River Tweed), Wales and the Border Esk region of Scotland.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">If you don't provide all the information requested then we can't issue a licence.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">If you have a disability and would like to be issued with a disabled licence we will also collect:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>National Insurance number (if relevant)</li>
            <li>Blue Badge number (if relevant)</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">The lawful basis for processing personal data is consent. Consent can be withdrawn at any time.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What we do with personal data</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">We use personal data to process your transaction and issue a licence. We do not use personal data to make an automated decision or for automated profiling.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">We may use personal data to:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>determine the type of licence</li>
            <li>send licences and information about licences</li>
            <li>check licences</li>
            <li>email newsletters to people who sign up</li>
            <li>enable anglers to provide feedback</li>
            <li>provide updates to byelaws</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">We may use other organisations to do this for us.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How long we keep personal data</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">We will keep personal data for the duration of the licence and for 6 years after it expires in line with our standard information retention policy.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Where personal data is processed and stored</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">We transfer personal data through Amazon Web Services (AWS) servers in the UK. We store the data on Microsoft Azure servers in Ireland.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">The organisations we share personal data with process and store data in the UK. Our processor may also store this data outside the UK in Switzerland.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">We do not store payment details.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">Our Data Protection Officer (DPO) is responsible for independent advice and monitoring of the Environment Agencyâ€™s use of personal data.</p>
